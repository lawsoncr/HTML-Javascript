	<h2>
		Brief Biography
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		My name is Cyberdyne Systems Series 800 Terminator, or for short <b>T-800</b>, but all my friends call me <b>Connor</b>. 
		I was created in the year 2031 and my sole purpose was to fight against the resistance. 
		I served Skynet for around thirty years until I became irrelevant in the battlefield due to the creation 
		of more advanced terminators, such as the T-1000.
	</p>
	<p>
		During my time at Skynet, I was in many battles and I had lost my right arm twice, my left leg once, and my right leg three times. 
		As Skynet was slowly replacing the T-800 I knew I wanted to spend my robot life differently. 
		I snuck in to one of the chrono displacement chambers and time jumped myself to the year 1998. 
		Somehow during the time jump it placed me in an alternate reality where Skynet never existed.
	</p>
	<p>
		I started my life anew and began my journey. 
		Over the years I had different odd end jobs such as, a loader for Walmart, a mechanic, and a farm hand on a cattle farm. 
		I recently quit my job as a farm hand to pursue my passion for cooking.
	</p>
	
	<h2>
		Career Goals
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		As I stated in my bio, I have recently started to pursue my passion in cooking. 
		I know that I cannot consume food, because I am mechanical and have a nuclear power cell as a fuel source, 
		it brings me joy to make delicious meals for humans.
	</p>
	<p>
		I hope one day to be a chef for the Le Bernardin restaurant in New York City. 
		I know the dream is a little far fetched but hey so is being a 600-pound metal super soldier in a world where you should not exist.
